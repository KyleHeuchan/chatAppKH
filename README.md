## Info about Project
- In this project I am making an online web application that is an instant messaging system that uses node.js, socket.io, and express. This application will be an instant messaging system that will load instantly without requiring to refresh the page. This will also provide a good template for future chat systems and builds.

## Step 1 Node Install)
- Test to see if we have installed node // node -v
- Test to see if we have npm installed  // npm -v
- Install express globally  // npm installs express-generator -g                                  // -g will make it global
- Command that creates the express application folder structure // express --view=pug chatapp            // After pug designate where the main folder will be
- Run the express application to test if it works // DEBUG=myapp:* npm start
- Include the necessary requirements for chat application
            (socket.io, express) = dependencies
            (grunt-contrib-sass, grunt-contrib-watch, grunt-contrib-uglify-es) = devDependencies

## Step 2 Cloning)
- Clone class files from Trevor-FanshaweC (chatApp) Repo into my own express application to use and work on.
- Modify css styling of the chat application.
- Added extra features to the chat application.

# Step 3 Grunt)
- Used Grunt to compile and shrink the css styles in the chatbox.
- Merge all files to master branch and uploaded.

## Running the Tests and Bug Reporting
- W3C Markup Validation
    - Built into Atom coding program
        - Atom automatically checks for W3C markup validation.
    - External: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
        - All code has to go through the validator to check for errors and bugs
    - CSS: http://www.css-validator.org/
        - All code has to go through the validator to check for errors and bugs
    - Preview using Firefox / Chrome / Console
